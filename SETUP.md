## Troubleshooting

### Python Not Found
```
'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```
**Solution**: Python not in PATH. Reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

### Port 5000 Already in Use
```
OSError: [Errno 10048] Only one usage of each socket address
```
**Solution**: Change port in `app.py`:
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='localhost', port=5001)  # Change 5000 to 5001
```

### Module Not Found
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'
```
**Solution**: Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Logo Not Showing
- Check file exists: `static/logo.png`
- Check file permissions (should be readable)
- Verify correct path in HTML: `<img src="static/logo.png"`

### Database Locked
- Close any other instances of the app
- Delete `.db-journal` file if it exists
- Restart the application

## Performance Tips

1. **Cache Images**: Use browser cache for static files
